Introduction
---------------------------------------------

Inventory purpose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To develop a clear and comprehensive understanding of what datasets exist, each City of Austin department should create an inventory that accounts for all datasets created or collected by the department. After creating the inventory, departments should continually make improvements by striving to expand, enrich, and open the inventory.

Objectives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Build an inventory that accounts for the department’s datasets.
2. Include datasets from both internal and external sources.
3. Indicate if the data may be made publicly available.
4. Describe the data with Open Data Initiative inventory field labels.

What is Data?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A value or set of values representing a specific concept or concepts. Data become “information” when analyzed and possibly combined with other data in order to extract meaning and to provide context. The meaning of data can vary depending on its context.

What is a Dataset?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A dataset is an organized collection of data. The most basic representation of a dataset is data elements presented in tabular form. Each column represents a particular variable. Each row corresponds to a given value of that column’s variable. A dataset may also present information in a variety of non-tabular formats, such as an extended mark-up language (XML) file, a geospatial data file, or an image file.

How to Facilitate Dataset Discovery
---------------------------------------------

It is the responsibility of liaisons to communicate with departments and data owners and relay the open data strategy by meeting face-to-face with departments to gain a better understanding of their data challenges. In order to fulfill the role of facilitators, liaisons must listen to the various challenges around data that may differ from department to department and be willing to adapt and evolve the plan from what is learned. In addition to discovering needs, these meetings serve to establish ongoing lines of communication with each department.

Identifying and engaging with key data customers to help determine the value of City datasets can help departments prioritize those of highest value for quickest release. Data customers include public as well as government stakeholders.

How to Create Your Dataset Inventory
---------------------------------------------

The first task for the data liaisons is to coordinate the creation of a departmental dataset inventory. Below, direction is provided on how to do this. The Open Data Team will make changes to this guidance based on the liaisons’ feedback. After the initial inventory creation, this process may continue as new datasets are created, discovered or requested by others.

Follow the 3 major steps below to conduct your data inventory:

1. Identify data sources.

2. Identify datasets from each data source.

3. Document dataset inventory.

Step 1: Identify Data Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data may be housed in a variety of places from inside information systems or databases stored on shared drives and folders. This can also include 3rd party vendors and data hosted on vendor systems. This first step is about identifying the major data sources in your department.

How to help identify data sources:

1. What information systems does your department use?

2. What databases does your department use?

3. What applications capture information or are used in your business processes?

4. Are some data resources kept in spreadsheets (on shared or individual drives)?

5. What information do you already publish? Where did that information come from?

Step 2: Identify potential datasets from each data source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of your information sources may be fairly straightforward. Frequently generated reports or spreadsheets would be examples of a dataset. Databases, may be very complex. Identifying subsets of the database that could serve as datasets, probably requires some brainstorming.

To help identify datasets, use the questions below:

1. What datasets are used for reports?

2. What datasets are publicly available online or elsewhere?

3. What datasets are used internally?

4. What information is published as a performance metric?

5. What data is reported to federal, state or local agencies?

6. What data do other departments ask for?

7. Include any datasets that may have sensitive information.

8. What datasets are included in PIR requests?

Step 3: Complete dataset inventory template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each dataset you identify in Step 2, add those datasets to the inventory. The dataset inventory will contain basic information about each dataset such as its title, description and sensitivity.

Required:

1. Department: The formal name of the Department most closely related to the dataset.

2. Title: Human-readable name of the dataset. Should be in plain English and include sufficient detail to facilitate search and discovery.

3. Description: Human-readable description (e.g., an abstract) with sufficient detail to enable a user to quickly understand whether the dataset is of interest.

4. Data Source: What is the source system or enterprise application from which the data originates?

5. Format: What is the primary state or file format for containing this dataset? (i.e. database, excel, CSV, JSON, other)

6. Contains External Data: Does this dataset incorporate information generated by agencies/organizations other than City of Austin? Is this Y/N or explanation of source?

7. Frequency: The frequency with which dataset is published. Need examples.

8. Estimated number of records: The approximate number of rows or records contained within the dataset. Why do we need this a mandatory?

9. Sensitivity: Does the dataset contain any rows and/or columns with potentially sensitive information? Yes or no.

10. Contact Name: Contact person name for the dataset.

11. Contact Email: Contact person's email for the dataset.

12. Unique Identifier: A unique identifier for the dataset or API as maintained within a catalog or database, when applicable. Needs better explanation. We are talking Socrata, why not say so.

Recommended:

1. Division: The division or organizational sub-unit of the department responsible for the dataset.

2. Data provided by: The department, division, office, unit, or team responsible for publishing the data. More discussion.

3. Dataset Owner: The username for the account used to create the dataset resource on Socrata. When applicable.

4. Category: Main thematic category of the dataset. (i.e., education, financial, neighborhood). I guess okay, but maybe more examples like the ones on Socrata. However, this could be a sprint item to update and correct categories. Let’s also talk about topics and meta data tags

5. Tags: Tags (or keywords) help users discover your dataset; please include terms that would be used by technical and non-technical users.

6. Row Label: Brief description of what one row represents; also called grain. Let’s be descriptive about this.

7. Spatial: The range of spatial applicability of a dataset. Could include a spatial region like a bounding box or a named place. Need examples.

8. Temporal: The range of temporal applicability of a dataset (i.e., a start and end date of applicability for the data). Let’s talk about the ISO 8601 format examples.

9. Transforms: Whether or not transformations have been applied between the times it was extracted from the original source and this publication.

10. Transforms Notes: A description of the steps or BI tools used to stage the data for publication, if applicable. (i.e., MicroStrategy, Microsoft Access) Create examples like sensitivity data removed or aggregated data sets. MicroStrategy.

How to Maintain the Dataset Inventory
---------------------------------------------

Departments should continue to expand and enhance their dataset inventory. Departments should regularly review evolving customer feedback and public engagement.

With the inventory of datasets, the department will then select their highest priorities. These priorities may include datasets that need to be shared internally as well as datasets that can be shared with the public.

**Objectives**

1. Expand datasets in the department’s inventory
2. Expand datasets from both internal and external sources.
3. Increase the ratio of public to non-public datasets in the inventory

Conclusion: Expand, Enrich, Open
----------------------------------------------

Departmental inventories will differ in size and maturity. In future phases, the Open Data Initiative will assess department progress toward overall maturity of the dataset inventory through the values of “Expand,” “Enrich,” and “Open.”

:Expand: Expanding the inventory refers to adding additional data assets to the Inventory. Departments should develop their own strategy. Departments should communicate their plans for expanding the inventory to the Open Data Team.

:Enrich: To improve the discoverability, management, and re-usability of datasets, departments should enrich the inventory over time by improving the quality of metadata describing each dataset.

:Open: Departments should implement processes that will accelerate the opening of additional valuable datasets by making them public and machine-readable, while ensuring adequate

safeguards are in place to prevent against the release of sensitive data. Departments should increase the number of public datasets included in the dataset inventory over time.
